# LuckyWheel

A reward wheel mini-game where the player spins a roulette to receive a random outcome.

When the Spin button is pressed, the wheel rotates for a fixed duration and lands on a random sector. Each sector represents a different type of reward or penalty.

Possible outcomes include:

Money: the player gains a random amount of coins.

Food: a random food item is awarded, converted to coins and added to the fridge.

Furniture: a random furniture item grants its corresponding coin value.

Fail: no reward is given and the player loses sanity.

Once the wheel stops, the selected reward is calculated, the player’s stats are updated, and the result is displayed on screen. The system prevents multiple spins at the same time and re-enables the button after the spin is complete.
